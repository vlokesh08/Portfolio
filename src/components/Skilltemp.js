        description: "The virtual mouse using OpenCV, Python, and MediaPipe is a computer vision-based system that enables users to control the cursor on their screen without physical mouse input. By leveraging hand tracking and gesture recognition algorithms, it detects hand movements and translates them into mouse actions, providing an intuitive and hands-free interaction experience.",
